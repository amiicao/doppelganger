   cd doppelganger
   ```
2. Build Docker image and run:

   ```
   docker build -t doppelganger . && docker run --name doppelganger doppelganger
   ```

or 

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   - `python -m venv venv`
   - `source venv/bin/activate`  # Use `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the Flask server:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Configure a GitHub Webhook:

   - Go to your GitHub repository settings
   - Navigate to "Webhooks" and click "Add webhook"
   - Enter the following details:
     - Payload URL: `https://your-public-url/webhook`

## Notes

- To make your Flask server publicly accessible, consider using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose it to the internet during development.
- Ensure proper security measures for the webhook endpoint to avoid unauthorized access or potential attacks.
